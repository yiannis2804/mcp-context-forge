Team Management Router.
This module provides FastAPI routes for team management including
team creation, member management, and invitation handling.

Examples:
    >>> from fastapi import FastAPI
    >>> from mcpgateway.routers.teams import teams_router
    >>> app = FastAPI()
    >>> app.include_router(teams_router, prefix="/teams", tags=["Teams"])
    >>> isinstance(teams_router, APIRouter)
    True
    >>> len(teams_router.routes) > 10  # Multiple team management endpoints
    True
