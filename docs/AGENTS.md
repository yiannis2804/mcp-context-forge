## Quick Commands

From `docs/` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build docs
make build                # Build static site

# Serve locally
make serve                # Serve at http://localhost:8000 (MkDocs default)

# Clean
make clean                # Remove build artifacts
```

From repository root:

```bash
make docs                 # Build documentation
make docs-serve           # Serve documentation locally
```

## Writing Documentation

### File Location

Place documentation in the appropriate subdirectory:

| Topic | Directory |
|-------|-----------|
| System design, ADRs | `docs/architecture/` |
| Deployment guides | `docs/deployment/` |
| Developer guides | `docs/development/` |
| Operations guides | `docs/manage/` |
| User guides | `docs/using/` |
| Test documentation | `docs/testing/` |

### Markdown Conventions

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Include front matter for navigation title if needed
- Use fenced code blocks with language hints
- Keep lines under 120 characters when practical

### Code Examples

Use fenced code blocks with language identifier:

```python
from mcpgateway import Gateway

gateway = Gateway()
gateway.start()
```

### Admonitions

```markdown
!!! note
    This is a note.

!!! warning
    This is a warning.

!!! tip
    This is a tip.
```

### Internal Links

```markdown
See [Configuration Reference](manage/configuration.md) for details.
See [Architecture Overview](architecture/index.md).
```

## Navigation

Navigation is configured in `mkdocs.yml`. When adding new pages:

1. Create the markdown file in the appropriate directory
2. Add an entry to the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`

## API Documentation

API documentation is auto-generated from OpenAPI schema:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:4444/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:4444/openapi.json`

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated to `docs/docs/coverage/`:

```bash
make htmlcov              # Generate HTML coverage report
```

## Key Documentation Pages

- `docs/development/developer-onboarding.md` - New contributor guide
- `docs/development/building.md` - Build system and testing
- `docs/manage/api-usage.md` - REST API guide
- `docs/architecture/index.md` - Architecture overview
- `docs/architecture/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records

## Important Notes

- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use relative links for internal references
