## 🛠 Developer Environment

MCP Gateway is built with:

* **Python 3.11+**
* **FastAPI** + **SQLAlchemy (async)** + **Pydantic Settings**
* **HTMX**, **Alpine.js**, **TailwindCSS** for the Admin UI

Development tools:

* Linters: `ruff`, `mypy`, `black`, `isort`
* Testing: `pytest`, `httpx`
* Serving: `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`

Frontend tools (Admin UI):

* Linters: ESLint, Stylelint, HTMLHint, Biome
* Formatting: Prettier
* Security: Retire.js (vulnerability scanning)

Code style and consistency is enforced via:

```bash
make lint          # runs ruff, mypy, black, isort
make lint-web      # runs ESLint, HTMLHint, Stylelint
make pre-commit    # runs pre-commit hooks on staged files
```

As well as GitHub Actions code scanning.

## 🧪 Testing

Test coverage includes:

* Unit tests under `tests/unit/`
* Integration tests under `tests/integration/`
* End-to-end tests under `tests/e2e/`
* UI automation under `tests/playwright/` (Playwright)
* Load testing under `tests/locust/` (Locust)
* Example payload performance testing under `tests/hey/`

Use:

```bash
make test                        # run full suite
pytest tests/unit/               # run only unit tests
pytest tests/e2e/                # run end-to-end scenarios
pytest tests/playwright/         # run UI automation tests
locust -f tests/locust/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:4444  # load testing
```

Note: JavaScript unit tests are not yet implemented; frontend testing relies on Playwright for UI automation.

### Database Performance Testing

```bash
make dev-query-log         # start server with query logging
make query-log-tail        # watch query log in real-time
make query-log-analyze     # analyze logs for N+1 patterns
make test-db-perf          # run N+1 detection tests
```

See [Database Performance](db-performance.md) for details.

## 🔍 Linting and Hooks

CI will fail your PR if code does not pass lint checks.

You should manually run:

```bash
make lint
make pre-commit
```

Enable hooks with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

---

## 🐳 Containers

Build and run with Podman or Docker:

```bash
make podman            # build production image
make podman-run-ssl    # run with self-signed TLS at https://localhost:4444
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Admin UI uses email/password authentication (`PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`PASSWORD`). API endpoints require JWT tokens (Basic Auth is disabled by default).

To generate a JWT token:

```bash
export MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token --username admin@example.com --exp 10080 --secret my-test-key)
echo $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN
```

Then test:

```bash
curl -sX GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4444/tools | jq
```

---

## 📦 Configuration

Edit `.env` or set environment variables. A complete list is documented in the [Configuration Reference](../manage/configuration.md).

Use:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key configs include:

| Variable            | Purpose                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`      | Database connection          |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`    | Signing key for JWTs         |
| `DEV_MODE=true`     | Enables relaxed development defaults (set together with `RELOAD=true` if you rely on `run.sh`) |
| `CACHE_TYPE=memory` | Options: memory, redis, none |
